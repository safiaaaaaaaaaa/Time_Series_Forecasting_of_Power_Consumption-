## Time_Series_Forecasting_of_Power_Consumption-
# Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting energy consumption using historical data from a householdâ€™s electricity usage. The main objective is to predict future power consumption trends, which can aid in energy optimization, resource planning, and better decision-making. The project employs statistical modeling techniques, specifically the ARIMA model, to perform the forecasting.

# Problem Statement
Accurate forecasting of energy consumption is crucial for efficient energy management and planning. Fluctuating electricity demand can lead to resource wastage or shortages. This project aims to develop a time series forecasting model to predict future electricity usage based on historical data.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical records of electricity usage and includes the following features:

Date: The date of the observation.
Time: The specific time of the observation.
Global_active_power: Total power consumed (in kilowatts).
Global_reactive_power: Power stored and later returned (in kilowatts).
Voltage: Voltage levels during the observation.
Global_intensity: Average intensity of current.
Sub_metering_1, Sub_metering_2, Sub_metering_3: Energy consumption measured by different sub-meters.

# Data Preprocessing:
Combined the Date and Time columns into a single datetime index for proper time series formatting.
Handled missing or null values by appropriate imputation or removal techniques.
Conducted stationarity checks using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test and applied differencing to achieve stationarity.


# Methodology
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized trends, seasonality, and patterns in the data using time series plots.
Identified peaks and troughs in energy consumption, ensuring the data's suitability for forecasting.

Stationarity Check
Performed the ADF test to ensure the dataset met the stationarity requirement for ARIMA modeling.
Differenced the data to remove trends and stabilize the variance.

ARIMA Model Implementation
Analyzed Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots to determine the appropriate values for ARIMA parameters (p, d, q).
Built and fitted the ARIMA model using the optimal parameters.
Evaluated the model's performance using metrics like AIC and BIC for model selection.

Forecasting
Generated forecasts for future energy consumption over a specified period.
Visualized the forecast results alongside the historical data to assess accuracy and trends.


# Results
Model Performance:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.052
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.054

# Insights:
The model accurately captures the trends in energy consumption.
Forecasted values align well with historical patterns, validating the model's reliability.


# Technologies Used
Python: For data preprocessing, visualization, and modeling.

Libraries:
pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
matplotlib and seaborn: Data visualization.
statsmodels: ARIMA modeling and statistical analysis.
scikit-learn: Evaluation metrics for model performance.


# Challenges and Solutions
Non-stationary Data: Addressed by differencing and validating stationarity with the ADF test.
Parameter Tuning: Used ACF and PACF plots along with AIC/BIC scores for selecting optimal ARIMA parameters.
Model Evaluation: Focused on interpretable metrics (MAE and RMSE) and visualizations to ensure forecast accuracy.

# Applications
This project can be extended to various domains like:
Energy demand forecasting for utility companies.
Resource allocation and energy grid optimization.
Anomaly detection in energy usage patterns.

# Future Scope
Incorporate other machine learning techniques like LSTMs for comparison with ARIMA.
Extend the model to multi-variate forecasting by including additional features like temperature or weather conditions.
Deploy the model as a web application for real-time forecasting.
